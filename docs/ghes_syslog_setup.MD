# Sending GitHub Enterprise Server Logs to Splunk

GitHub Enterprise Server comes with syslog-ng built in to send data to platforms like Splunk and we can take advantage of that with the [Splunk Add-on for GitHub](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/6254/). Setup details and documentation is available on [Splunk Docs](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/released/GitHub/About).
